### About
- This project was an application of an **Unsupervised Learning**  which seeks to cluster similar countries using the **K-Means++ Clustering Algorithm**. The clustering is done for countries on the basis of health based and socio-economic factors and thus a subset of most deprived countries is extracted.
- The most in need countries were clustered together depending upon various factors like *income per capita, health expenditure by gov.
per capita, mortality rate of children* and some other important factors which determined the overall develoment of a country. 
- All the relevant score plots, histograms and EDA plots are included in the repository.
- The notebook, **Clustering Countries.ipynb** contains the final notebook. Click [here](https://nbviewer.org/github/TheGupta2012/Clustering-Countries/blob/master/Clustering%20Countries%20.ipynb) if the notebook is not rendered properly.
